Power of the Adaptive Linear Neuron (AdaLiNe) in signal processing!

üîç What is AdaLiNe (Adaptive Linear Neuron)? AdaLiNe is a type of artificial neuron that adapts its weights based on the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. It's a linear model that adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values, making it ideal for various signal processing tasks.
üí° Application in Harmonic Extraction
In this animation, I illustrate how AdaLiNe can be used to extract harmonics and DC offset from voltage and current signals. This process is crucial for active power filters (APFs), which selectively compensate for harmonic distortion in power systems. By accurately identifying and isolating these harmonics, APFs can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of electrical power delivery.
üìä Animation Highlights
Harmonic Extraction: Watch how the AdaLiNe neuron adapts to extract specific harmonic components and DC offset from the signal.
Real-Time Adaptation: Observe the dynamic adjustment of the AdaLiNe neuron in real-time signal processing.
